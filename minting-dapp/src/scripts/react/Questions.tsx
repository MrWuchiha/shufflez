        In the simplest terms, tarot cards are used for fortune-telling to gain insight on one's situation. 
        Each card usually has an underlying meaning, traditionally depicted by the symbolisms on the card's illustration. 
        Tarot cards have a nearly 600 year history. 
        The most known deck is the Rider tarot deck comprised of 78 cards, with 22 <strong>trumps</strong> and 56 <strong>suit cards</strong>. 
        Many variations exist today. See <a href='https://www.britannica.com/topic/tarot' target='_blank'>this detailed explanation <div className="icons text-sm"><FaExternalLinkAlt /></div></a>.

        We plan to release variations of tarot decks! Contact us if you'd like to put your deck out! We'd like to build a common 
        space for divination and web3 enthusiasts, and your art would be greatly appreciated <span className="emoji">üòù</span>! 
        The idea is to give free guidance in a community setting, for you to release your own fun, hand-drawn deck.
